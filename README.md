# Seeking ways to revitalize graduate school through analysis of graduate student characteristics

## Background
- The university wants to change into a research-oriented university.
- In addition to the graduate school application policy, it is necessary to analyze the current status of graduate students through graduate school analysis and to check which students usually go to graduate school.


## Propose
- This study aims to analyze the medical characteristics of graduate students and explore ways to enter graduate schools in the future.
